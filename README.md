# CareFlow-Clinical-Pathway-Process-Mining

End-to-end healthcare analytics and process mining repository tracking clinical pathways, patient flows, and operational insights.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project uses Process Mining techniques to analyze clinical event logs (hospital workflows). It identifies how patients move through the healthcare system, discovers bottlenecks, checks protocol compliance, and visualizes operational insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **PM4Py** (Process Mining algorithms)
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Graphviz** (Process model rendering)

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jiyamulla1212-dev/CareFlow-Clinical-Pathway-Process-Mining.git
   cd CareFlow-Clinical-Pathway-Process-MiningUpdated Clinical Pathway Analytics project workspace, documentation, and data models for Power BI integration.
## Data Model Updates (Nov 3, 2026)
Configured process mining relationships and updated pathway stage tables.
Added new measure logic for average patient wait time across clinical stages.
Updated dashboard layout, report theme colors, and interactive slicer panel.
Refined report visual formatting, tooltips, and measure performance in Power BI.

## Process Mining and PBIP Integration

Run `python src\process_mining.py` from the repository root to generate the
Power BI import tables under `data\processed`. See
[docs/power_bi_integration.md](docs/power_bi_integration.md) for the output
schema, model relationships, DAX measures, and PBIP setup steps.
## Updates (Nov 4, 2026)
Configured dataset schema mappings and validated event log structures.
Refined process mining script to output throughput times and bottleneck tables.
Added DAX measures for patient wait times and configured report tooltips.
Completed local setup, dependency checks, and daily project progress log.
## Update (Nov 5, 2026)
Documented pipeline execution steps and dashboard layout requirements.
